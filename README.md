# Project Background
This is the mobile application code for pubcoasters, an application that allows users to post about bars in their areas.
This is the DEV repo as when it was an active project, new features would be added here first, tested and validated, before getting promoted to the live website.
Some features include being able to create posts, edit posts, delete posts, leave comments and likes on posts, track busyness of bars, as well as following other users.

## Tech Stack
The mobile application is written using the flutter framework which allows for mobile apps on both iOS and Android to be written from the same codebase.
